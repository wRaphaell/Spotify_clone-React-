# Spotify Clone

## Description

This project is a clone of the Spotify desktop application, built using React. The initial focus is on creating a interactive front-end that mimics the design and functionality of the Spotify interface. This is my first project using React, and I plan to expand it further by implementing back-end functionalities in the future.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Replicates the look and feel of the Spotify desktop app, including the sidebar, player controls, and playlists.
- **Playlist and Song Search**: To make this app more useful, including the ability to create playlists and search for songs (if a suitable API is found).
- **User Information Storage**: To implement user data storage and learn valuable technologies like PostgreSQL.
